Write a program that repeatedly asks the user to enter product names and prices.
Store all this in a dictionary, the keys of which are the names of products, and the values are prices. 
When the user finishes entering products and prices, allow him to re-enter the product name and print the corresponding price or message if the product is not in the dictionary.
